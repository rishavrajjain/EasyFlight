## Inspiration

- Our personal experience in India,waiting in Queues has been a very big problem and having a complete digital experience was always a expectation
- For connecting and interchanging flight,Baggage has always been an issue.Keep tracking of the Baggage status would be amazing.
- Many Indians (Generally above the age of 45) have been facing issues due to difference in Languages and no support in their native language.

These Reasons inspired us to make Easy Flight for a seamless flight Experience


## Workflow

## How we built it

- We used React.js for our frontend and Node.js for our backend.
- Our node server handles user management and sessions and is used to get the boarding pass and bag journey details by calling the SITA API
- Azure Language API for translation 
- Our Node server is hosted on Heroku and React app on Netlify.

## SITA APIs used
- Bag Journey API
- Flight Follower API
- Waiting Time API
- Boarding Pass API

## Accomplishments we are proud of 
- how the final website came about
- how this website has great possibilities to add value to the passengers

## What's next 
- Currently User has to input a lot of data to get details out as it is required by the API. We would like to automate some of it, Like just once using the website and scanning the bagtag and continously getting its history and status and similarly to other APIs
